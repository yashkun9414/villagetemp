# 🚀 Simple Fix - Get Your Bot Working

## ❌ Current Issue
Your Railway deployment is running the **website** (`app.py`) instead of the **bot** (`bot_host.py`).

## ✅ Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Fix Railway Settings
1. Go to your Railway bot project dashboard
2. Click **Settings** → **Deploy**
3. Change **Start Command** to: `python bot_host.py`
4. Click **Deploy** to restart

### Option 2: Create New Bot Project
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click **New Project**
3. **Deploy from GitHub repo** → Select `amyashpal/villagetemp`
4. In settings, set:
   - **Start Command**: `python bot_host.py`
   - **Environment Variables**:
     ```
     TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=8235992714:AAED7tTjm6waV6Ak-L-_LgRz37ZfnuEnE4w
     ```

## 🧪 Test Your Bot
After fixing:
1. Go to https://t.me/VillaegWarningbot
2. Send `/start` - should get welcome message
3. Send `/weather` - should work with real weather data

## 📊 Correct Bot Logs
When working, you'll see:
```
🚀 Starting Gujarat Weather Alert Bot...
✅ Loaded 33 districts and 72620 location records
✅ Bot is now LIVE and responding!
```

## 🌐 Two Separate Deployments Needed
- **Bot Project**: `python bot_host.py` (for Telegram)
- **Website Project**: `python app.py` (for web interface)

Your bot code is perfect - it just needs to run the right file!
